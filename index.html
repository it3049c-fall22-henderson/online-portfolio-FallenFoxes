  <div id="personalBackground">
<p>I am a 21 year old undergraduate student at University of Cincinnati studying 2 tracks out of the IT major, therefore making me a double major. I am studying Software Development
  and Game/Simulation Development. I have also taken on a minor in Psychology. I love to play video games in my spare time, when I am not working my 2 jobs. I also have a loving calico
  kitty who is named Chloe and she is the best pet anyone could ask for!
</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Work Development Experience">
<p>At the age of 15, I got my first job at Kings Island in the food department. I worked there for about 5 years, working my way up the management chain and becoming a part of middle 
  management before leaving due to unforseen circumstances. I quickly found a job at a legal research firm where I was able to not only demonstrate my skills to be an IT professional,
  but also show off that I had decent experience with customer service. A year later, I found myself working at Chipotle and gaining tuition reimbursement. 5 months later, I was on Co-Op
  at UC's Lindner College of Busniess in AV. I stayed there over the summer after the spring and I am currently also working at Lindner College of Busniess for my 2nd rotation as the help desk
  manager. On top of that, I stuck with working at Chipotle during these times as well!
